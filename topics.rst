Research Topics
***************************

The following research topics have been proposed by various faculty members of the RSE. 

.. note:: 

   In the first week of the semester I will try to match up students with supervisors. Note that
   this process will be double-blind. You do not know which supervisor proposed which topic, the
   supervisor does not know which student chooses her/his topic. Also, each topic will only be
   assigned to one student.

   Details on the matching algorithm will be provided during lecture. It would be a clever strategy
   of yours to make a ranking of topics rather than fixating on one particular topic.

       Title: Do bequest motives explain the annuity puzzle?

       Summary: There is a vast literature that tries to explain why annuities markets are thin. One
       natural explanation is a bequest motive. Most of the literature shows that the existence of
       bequest motives decrease demand for the annuities. Yet, we also observe that most people do
       not annuitize any wealth at all. In a recent paper, Lockwood (2012, RED) shows that, with
       plausible bequest motive, people can be better off not annuitizing any wealth at available
       rates. His model is capable of generating the stylized facts regarding annuities market in
       the US. Similar to the US, Australia has also very thin annuities market. In this project we
       will replicate Lockwood’s model first to generate a similar set of results. Afterwards, we
       will calibrate model to the Australian economy to provide another explanation of the annuity
       puzzle.

       Description of numerical analysis: We use a simple life-cycle model with a twist: a bequest
       motive and use standard numerical dynamic programming methods such as value function
       iteration to solve the maximization model.  Most parts of the code will be provided. Students
       are expected to extend the coded in a sensible manner.

       this project does NOT expect/require any previous experience with Matlab programming. The
       student will learn the necessary programming skills under the guidance of the supervisor.

       Project title: How Well Does the Means-tested Social Insurance System Provide Insurance?

       Summary: Macroeconomic and welfare implications of various type of social insurance programs,
       including old age pension, public health insurance, and unemployment insurance programs are
       widely analyzed in the literature. Yet, only a small set of papers, actually, analyze how
       well does these insurance programs provide insurance. For instance, Huggett and Parra (2010,
       JPE) analyze the insurance provided by the US Pay As You Go (PAYG) social security by using a
       dynamic-stochastic model. Australia has a distinct social pension program: means-tested
       pension program. It differs from the PAYG system in many dimensions including financing
       structure and calculations of benefits.  In this project we will ask the following question:
       How well does the means-tested socials insurance system provide insurance? Our model will
       mimic that of Huggett and Parra closely and compare social insurance power of means-tested
       pension program with that of PAYG.

       Description of numerical analysis: We use a simple life-cycle model and use standard
       numerical dynamic programming methods such as value function iteration to solve the
       maximization model.  Most parts of the code will be provided. Students are expected to extend
       the coded in a sensible manner.

       Title: Are cognitive development tests biased against bi-lingual children?

       Summary: A number of studies have hypothesised that vocabulary tests used for assessing the cognitive
       development of children are negatively biased for children who speak languages other than English at
       home. While standardisation of test results attempts to account for this, it is acknowledged to work
       to a limited degree. Using data from the Millennium Cohort Study determine whether children from
       ethnic minority backgrounds (who speak a language other than English at home) have different
       patterns of achievement compared to children who only speak English at home. 

       Data: The data set available is the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS). This is a panel data set of
       approximately 13 000 British children born in 2000/01. Regression analysis can be run to determine
       differences in results between English only versus not only English speakers across a range of
       different tests at a variety of ages.

       Title: Does the gender of your siblings matter for your cognitive ability?

       Summary: A number of studies the US have hypothesised that different sex compositions of families can
       influence the educational outcomes of the children in the family.  Some studies (such as Butcher and
       Case 1994) find that women’s educational achievement is influenced by the sex composition of her
       siblings, while a man’s is not. In particular, having brothers has a positive influence on a woman’s
       level of educational achievement. However, Conley (2000) posits that an increase in the number of
       opposite sex siblings is detrimental for the sex minority children. 

       Data: Using data from the British Millennium Cohort Study (MCS), assess whether there is evidence of
       sibship sex composition influencing the cognitive ability of the cohort children. The MCS is a panel
       data set of approximately 13 000 British children born in 2000/01.

       Project Title: Wealth Distribution in Australia 
       
       Summary: Wealth is enormously important for
       individual households as well as the overall economy. Wealth provides security to households,
       ability to deal with economic uncertainty and plan for future. It can also generate income
       directly. In this project the student will study the Wealth distribution in Australia. The
       Household, Income and Labor Dynamics in Australia (or HILDA) survey is a panel data set in which
       we have detailed information on household wealth for three years-2002, 2006 and 2010. Students
       will study the overall composition of household wealth and if there have been any significant
       changes in its distribution between the years 2002-2010. They will also analyze distribution of
       wealth as we go across the households in different stages of their life cycle. If time permits,
       students can also investigate if there are any household characteristics like health, spells of
       unemployment etc. which can significantly explain changes in a household’s wealth.
       
       Description of numerical analysis: Students will use wealth information available in three rounds
       of Household, Income and Labor Dynamics in Australia (or HILDA) survey. The data from this survey
       is made available by Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic Research on submission of a research
       proposal. Use of least squares, IV estimation will be required.

       Project Title: Savings Behavior in Australia 
       
       Summary: Do households with higher lifetime income have
       better saving habits? If true it can partly explain the high degree of inequality in wealth
       distribution and prove extremely useful for design of tax and macroeconomic policies. In this
       project the student will investigate the determinants of savings behaviour in Australia and conduct
       tests on whether there are significant differences in savings behaviour for different socio-economic
       groups. The Household, Income and Labor Dynamics in Australia (or HILDA) survey will be used for
       this study. HILDA is a panel data set in which we have detailed information on income, education and
       other household characteristics such as attitude towards savings. There is also information on
       wealth for three years 2002, 2006 and 2010 which can be used to construct a proxy for savings
       behavior. Students will study if there is a significant difference in the savings behavior of
       households as we move from low to high permanent income groups.  
       
       Description of numerical analysis: Students will use Household, Income and Labor Dynamics in Australia (or HILDA) survey. The data from
       this survey is made available by Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic Research on submission of a
       research proposal. Use of median regression, estimation of probit/logit model estimation will be
       required.

      Title: Economic benefits from transport infrastructure 
      
      Summary: Transportation infrastructure is
      considered essential for raising economic activity and growth potential, but quantifying the
      benefits relies on counterfactual comparisons. This project will compare static welfare gains from
      investment in transportation infrastructure (eg, railroads) to those estimated from realized
      economic outcomes (eg, commodity prices), based on official economic data. The static component will
      be a counterfactual comparison based on social savings techniques, while estimates of realized
      economic outcomes will utilize a reduced form model found in the applied microeconomic literatures
      (eg, development, trade, labor). The student will identify a suitable country and time period for
      analysis, collect data for both counterfactual and realized economic outcomes, and perform the
      analyses to demonstrate the benefits of infrastructure investment.

        Title: Identifying long-run patterns in industrial change 
        
        Summary: Economic development
        typically follows a standard trajectory, with economies shifting from agriculture and primary
        production to manufacturing. Less obvious are the mechanisms underlying this process and variations
        between countries, particularly the composition of industries over time. This project will identify
        factors that are associated with industrial change from a panel of countries using official economic
        data, and estimate their relative contributions using standard reduced form regression models. The
        student will identify a set of countries starting in the late nineteenth century, collect data for
        these countries, and perform analyses to compare relative performance over time.

       Title: The Market for Status Goods
       
       Summary: a status good provides not only intrinsic utility to its owner, but it also enhances
       the social status of the consumer who uses it. In Mazali and Rodrigues-Neto GEB 2013, we
       developed the economic theory for the market of pure status goods as well as their optimal
       taxation using some assumption on functional forms.  This interesting and challenging project
       investigates the robustness of results when some alternative functional forms are introduced.
       The project has a strong theoretical component and a numerical component. It applies elements
       of Industrial Organization and Public Economics.  
       
       Description of numerical analysis: In this project the student will explore other functional
       forms for utility functions and benefits of status goods. Simulations of the model’s results
       under the alternative specifications will be produced. The study will start with (and go well
       beyond) the analysis of the numerical examples in the main reference.

       not essential) that the student has some knowledge of Industrial Organization and Public
       Economics.

      Title: Corruption with Two Forms of Payment
      
      Summary: non-monetary forms of payment
      might be used to conceal corruption activities. Such activities are risky in the sense that if
      detected, agents may be punished hardly for engaging in corruption activities. In many cases
      there is a tradeoff between the safety of bribe payments and its efficiency. Non-monetary
      payments are typically harder to detect and punish but generate some inefficiency. In
      Rodrigues-Neto EM (2014) this tradeoff is analyzed under simplified assumptions on functional
      forms.  
      
      Description of numerical analysis: In this project the student will explore
      alternative functional forms to check for the robustness of the results. Simulations of the
      model’s results under the alternative specifications will be produced.  
      
      Software used: MS Excel (essential), Matlab (desirable).

      not essential) that the student has some knowledge of the economics of crime and punishment
      and the basics of corruption. Pareto optimality, graphic analysis and solid multivariable
      calculus and linear algebra skills are essential.

       Title: Structural instabilities in the inflation-inflation uncertainty relationship

       Summary: There is a large empirical literature on understanding the relationship between inflation
       and inflation uncertainty. Empirical work generally supports the claim that higher inflation
       generates higher inflation uncertainty, whereas there is mixed support in the reverse
       direction—i.e., higher inflation uncertainty generates higher inflation. This project investigates
       if this mixed evidence is caused by structural instabilities, in particular due to the adoption of
       inflation targeting by the central bank. 

       Description of numerical analysis: The student will collect inflation data of Australia, New Zealand
       and the G7 countries (which are all publicly available) for analysis. GARCH models will be used to
       generate a measure of inflation uncertainty.

       Title: Macroeconomic forecasting using factors

       Summary: Recent advances in information technology make it possible to access thousands of economic
       time series. How to make use of this abundance of data to improve macroeconomic forecasts becomes an
       important area of research. Stock and Watson (2002) study forecasting a macroeconomic time series
       variable using a large number of predictors, where they are summarized using a small number of
       indexes or factors. In their paper, the number of factors is fixed. This project investigates if
       choosing time-varying number of factors judiciously would improve forecast performance. 

       Description of numerical analysis: The student will use a famous Stock and Watson dataset that is
       publicly available. Principal component analysis will be used in forecasting.

       Title: Honesty and disclosure: an experiment 
             
       Summary: Cain, Loewenstein and Moore (2005, 2011) report on experiments designed to illuminate the
       effects on the honesty of advice when remuneration contracts of advisers are disclosed to
       clients.  They demonstrate perverse outcomes: when these contracts are disclosed prior to the
       advisory relationship advisers tend to exaggerate their advice in their own favour even more
       than previously.  Given proposed Future of Financial Advice (FOFA) reforms in Australia, this
       is a topical issue here and the proposal is to conduct and analyse an experiment along the
       lines of Cain, Loewenstein and Moore.  The idea would be to replicate their experiment – at
       least, as conducted by Dan Ariely – but adapted slightly to see any impacts of requiring
       advisers to act in the interests of the client, as in the Australian case. 
       
       Numerical analysis: This is an experiment. It will involve designing and conducting an
       experiment and analyzing the collected data. I would hope for maybe 60 subjects, reaped from
       first-year Econ classes, in order to provide 2 or 3 different treatments. Each subject would
       pair with another in an exercise that would take no more than 10 minutes.

       Title: The Gregory thesis: a simulation 
       
       Summary: The Gregory thesis (or “Dutch disease” or “Malaise Hollandaise”) argues that an
       export boom can be de-industrialising. A simple yet elegant model of the phenomenon can be
       found in Corden and Neary (1982) and they demonstrate, in a Ricardo-Viner (specific factors)
       setting, that, while an exogenous export price will raise wages for sure and contract the
       import-competing sector, its consequences for many other variables of interest – the sizes of
       the nontradeables and aggregate tradeables sectors, the return to capital in the export
       sector etc. – are ambiguous. The proposal is that a student construct a numerical version
       of this model and simulate it to illustrate how conclusions depend on the size of income
       effects, labour demand elasticities and so forth.
       
       Numerical analysis: This is a simulation exercise. It would be nice to use numbers based on
       some idea of reality, but not essential. It involves constructing a very low-dimensional (n
       goods, n+1 factors, where n is at least 3) general equilibrium model and simulating it.

       Software used: Up to the student.  My own experience with numerical simulations – albeit
       pretty limited – is with GAUSS but the model is sufficiently simple that it might even be
       feasible in MS Excel.
       
       Student prerequisites: Ideally some familiarity with trade theory, particularly the specific
       factors model, would be nice, but it’s not essential. What is essential is some facility with
       appropriate software for setting up the simulation.

       Title: Real Exchange Rates in Developed Countries: Does the Balassa-Samuelson Hypothesis Hold?  
       
       Summary: Balassa (1964) and Samuelson (1964) (BS) provide a well-known explanation of
       long-run real exchange rate behaviour based on productivity differentials between traded and
       non-traded sectors in economies with freely adjusting wages and prices. The argument is that
       higher productivity growth in the traded sector at home than in foreign countries (given the
       productivity improvement in the non-traded sector is slow) is associated with higher relative
       price of non-traded goods, leading to a real appreciation of the domestic currency. However,
       the existing literature has so far provided mixed evidence on the BS hypothesis. This project
       asks you to examine whether the BS hypothesis has played an important role in explaining
       long-run real exchange rate movements in developed countries.
       
       Description of numerical analysis: Student will use a suitable data set (will be provided),
       including sectoral prices and productivities constructed by a novel approach for classifying

       Title: Which Method is the Best for Forecasting Economic Activity in Australia?

       Summary: Prediction of the future state of economic activity is of importance to a wide number of
       sectors and policy makers. Several researchers have developed a large number of forecasting methods.
       Traditional forecasting methods rely on a small set of variables as it is difficult to include a
       large number of leading indicators into one equation. Recent research shows that including more
       leading indicators can help enhance the forecasting accuracy. There exists a large variety of
       approaches for the estimation of data-rich prediction methods.  This project aims to identify the
       best method  to forecast the economic activity in Australia by investigating several econometric
       methods such as the univariate autoregressive model, forecasting with the best in-sample predictor,
       combining forecasts based on different predictors, the principal component factor model, and the
       partial least squares regression model.  
       
       Description of numerical analysis: Student will use time series data (will be provided)
       including a large set of leading economic indicators to develop time series forecasting
       models with partial least squares and principal components analysis.

       Title: A comparison of Citation counts of the original statements of the Solow and Swan Neoclassical
       Growth Models 
   
       Summary: In 1956 two statements of the ‘neoclassical growth model’ appeared within in a few
       months of each other, and apparently independently.

       - Solow, Robert M. 1956, "A Contribution to the Theory of Economic Growth" Quarterly Journal of
         Economics  70 (1) 65–9

       - Swan, T.W. 1956, ‘Economic Growth and Capital Accumulation’ Economic Record 32(63) 334–361

       Solow’s presentation of the growth model has taken the lion’s share of the profession’s attention.
       It would be interesting to make this impression more exact by undertaking an analysis of the
       citation counts of the two papers. This would consist of constructing time profiles of the citations
       of the two papers, and making a comparison. Such an analysis would also seek differences ‘in space’
       (i.e. comparisons of the extent of citations Australian with non-Australian journals). Common
       citations -- where the two papers are cited in the same document --  could also be investigated.   

       The investigator would need to take care in choosing amongst the several rival sources of
       citations:

       - Thomson-Reuters ISI (‘Web of Science’)

       - Scopus

       - Google Scholar

       - JSTOR
 
       These have various merits and demerits: the Web of Science is natural sciences biased; Google
       Scholar is biased to recent years; JSTOR has almost no Australian journals.
 
       The investigator will find guidance in are papers on citations of journals and individual
       authors:
 
       - William M. Landes, Richard A. Posner 2000 , “Citations, Age, Fame, and the Web” The Journal of
         Legal Studies, 29, S1

      Topic: Ronald Max Hartwell: A Chronological (and Briefly Annotated) Bibliography

      Summary: R.M Hartwell (1921-2009) was an Australian-born economic historian who was a pioneer
      of the post-war “quantitative revolution” in economic history. He is best known for his paper
      “The rising standard of living in England, 1800-1850" which put him at odds with Marxist
      historians by arguing that Britain's industrialisation had improved the lot of the poor.
 
      Hartwell is made especially interesting to ANU researchers as his extensive papers have been
      deposited in the National Library of Australia.
 
      It would be valuable to construct a bibliography of his 60 year career of research. This would
      extend beyond academic journals and books to include items in his papers at the NLA (excluding
      personal letters etc, but including unpublished publications of scholarly interest: lectures
      notes, correspondence with economists on economics and economic history).
 
      The items would be listed in chronological order. Items would also be occasionally explained
      (or ‘annotated’); so letters, for example, would have their content briefly recorded. (Thus:
      ‘2 May 1959 Letter to Milton Friedman’ is not be very helpful ‘but ‘2 May 1959 Letter to
      Milton Friedman: RMH requests data on US fixed deposits held in the UK’ is more so).
 
      The bibliography would be prefaced by a statement explaining any particular methodology used
      and challenges faced. It would also attempt to trace in the chronology the paths taken by
      various strands of Hartwell’s interests.
 
      Related literature: The paper that would serve the investigator best as a model (but still
      lacking annotations) is;

        Economics Review 51,http://search.proquest.com/assets/r20141.1.1-2/core/spacer.gif106-128.

    Project Title: The Responsiveness of Monetary and Fiscal Policy to Economic Downturns

    Summary: Most governments try to smooth the business cycle. In particular, monetary and fiscal policy becomes
    more expansionary during an economic downturn. In this empirical exercise, the student will study
    the properties of discretionary fiscal and monetary responses to downturns. 

    The properties to be investigated are the timeliness, duration, strength and symmetry of policies,
    with comparisons made between fiscal and monetary policy and across countries. The paper on which
    this study is based conducts such an exercise for the G7 countries. The student is encouraged to
    widen the study to include other countries, in particular Australia, to use more recent data and to
    consider alternative VAR specifications for the estimation.

    While there have been numerous studies looking at the effects of fiscal and monetary policy on the
    business cycle, little has been done analysing the response of fiscal and monetary policy to changes
    in the business cycle. A deeper understanding of this process will help inform policy makers at
    treasuries and central banks.

    Description of Numerical Analysis: The student will need to run vector autoregressions (VARs) and diagnostics using publicly available
    macroeconomic data on various countries, including Australia.

   Project Title: Do Asset Price Booms Reduce Economic Stability? Evidence from a Panel of OECD Countries 

   Summary: There is still considerable disagreement about the economic effects of asset prices, especially when
   they appear to be unjustified by fundamentals. This study asks whether asset prices affect not only
   the means, but also higher order moments of macroeconomic variables such as inflation and output. In
   particular, a panel probit regression is used to test whether asset price booms in various asset
   markets (equity and housing) significantly raise the probability at the margin that the output gap
   will be in the left tail of its distribution or that the price-level gap will be in the right tail
   of its distribution. The results are checked for robustness and tested for symmetry.

   Existing work on a panel of East Asian countries has found that asset price booms indeed
   (asymmetrically) fatten the tails of the distributions of the output gap and the price-level gap;
   however, no such work has been done for industrialized OECD countries, including Australia. 

   Description of Numerical Analysis: The student will need to run panel probit regressions, quantile regressions, and diagnostics using
   publicly available macroeconomic and finance data on various OECD countries, including Australia.

    Summary: If the signals agents receive about a project are not identical then the organizational
    structure and decision rules employed will have a significant impact on the disruption of
    projects accepted and rejected. The two most obvious arrangements are parallel and sequential
    (oversight).

    This project will examine the performance of different organizational structures and rules, in
    different decision contexts through numerical simulation. The simulations will identify which
    rules/structures are optimal in which situations. This is important for the design of
    decision-making processes in both public and private settings.

   Project title: The role and implications of tuition discrimination in higher education 
 
   Summary: A controversial issue in higher education is who should bear the cost: taxpayers or 
   students. In the last decades there has been a worldwide decline in public support that has 
   led universities to charge higher tuition fees, and also often to employ discriminatory tuition 
   policies to raise more revenue. In Australia, for example, international and domestic 
   students are subject to different fee schedules. Moreover, domestic students have access to 
   income-contingent loans that attract a zero real interest rate and provide, hence, an 
   additional implicit subsidy. Fethke (2011) proposes a simple theoretical model to analyse 
   the implications of tuition discrimination on enrolment and student welfare in a setting 
   where government and universities have different objectives and act strategically. The aim 
   of this project is to explore further the role and implications of tuition discrimination. 
 
   Description of numerical analysis: Fethke (2011) proposes a relatively simple model with 
   specific functional assumptions. We will replicate the results, both analytically and 
   numerically, and explore the implications of changes in relevant parameters and functional 
   forms on the results.

    Project title: The effect of taxes and public expenditures on time use in Australia 
    
    Summary: There is an extensive literature on the importance of taxes for explaining market work
    across countries and over time. Ragan (2013) shows that differences in tax policy also have
    implications for the allocation of non-market time. For a group of 13 OECD countries she finds
    that differences in tax rates explain much of the variation in both market and non- market work.
    Accounting for public expenditures however further improves the fit, particularly for
    Scandinavian countries. The purpose of the project is to analyse the effects of taxes and public
    expenditures on market and non-market time use in Australia using Ragan’s theoretical model and
    numerical simulations as a benchmark.  Description of numerical analysis: Ragan (2013) proposes
    a theoretical model and provides numerical results for a group of 13 OECD countries. We will
    replicate the results for a few relevant countries and extend the analysis to Australia.

   Project Title: A Reexamination of Card, et al. “Inequality at Work”

   Summary: A number of empirical studies indicate that job satisfaction is correlated with relative
   pay. Card, et al. (2012) advances that literature by randomising access to information on co-worker
   salaries and thus providing a strategy to identify the impact of relative pay comparisons. In
   particular, an information treatment group was informed where salary information for their co-
   workers could be accessed while a control group was not. The study finds that with regards to job
   satisfaction and job search intentions, the information treatment had a negative effect for workers
   earning less than the median but no effect for workers paid above the median.
   With this Case Studies project, students will reexamine the assumptions or robustness of the results
   for this published paper using the data provided by the authors on the journal’s website. The
   particular focus of the reexamination will be determined by the student subject to the supervisor’s
   approval.

    Project Title: Union Wages Effects in Australia

    Summary: Wooden [2001] finds that the union-nonunion wage difference depends jointly on the
    extent of union membership ("union density") among workers and the presence of an "active union"
    at the workplace. This wage difference is not important within a workplace but is sizable across
    workplaces. For his analysis, Wooden uses the 1995 Australian Industrial Relations Survey (AWIRS
    A) which provides a matched employer-employee data set.
    Work from two earlier Case Studies projects and using the same AWIRS 95 data question Wooden’s
    conclusions. Carter [2008] finds a strong union wage effect at workplaces with agreements made
    before 1994 but not at those with agreements made after this time. Using a more direct measure of
    union involvement in negotiating agreements, McDonald [2012] finds inconclusive evidence of a
    union wage impact. This proposed Case Study will further probe the robustness of Wooden’s
    results.
