Tips for Writing a Referee Report in Economics
*************************************************

General Tips
=============

Comment on the manuscript's originality, clarity, contribution to the
literature, and relevance to real world problems.

Make suggestions about its length, organization, tables, and figures.

The bottom line is this: If there is an important idea in the paper, make
constructive comments (e.g., how to streamline the arguments, what parts
should be cut) and help the authors publish the paper.

If not, say so frankly. There is no point in beating about the bush. If the
paper is clearly below the journal standards, detailed comments are
unnecessary.

The paradox of refereeing is this: When you are a referee, you are the
expert. When the other person becomes a referee of your paper, he or she
becomes the expert. Circumstances can change.

Do not say in the report whether the paper should be accepted or rejected.
This belongs in the cover letter.

Be careful with your negative reports. Do not demoralize the authors.

Remember the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do
unto you.

Alternatively: Would you like to be at the receiving end of your own referee report?

Your role is not in finding all the faults
in the paper.

Write something good, something bad

Mortals cannot write “perfect” papers. Even the best paper has some
problems, and you can ask the author to make improvements.

You can recommend rejection for good reasons and still be kind to the
author.

Your evaluation should be based solely on the merit or ideas contained in
the paper

Avoid pointing out mathematical errors unless you are absolutely sure.

Measure the paper against its own promises. Does it actually answer the research question that it
asks? If not, you can reject the paper. If yes, you have to decisions to make:

1)  Is the research question interesting and important? (If the answer is no then you reject.)

2)  If it is important then you need to ask whether the answer logically follows from the methods
    and techniques used inside the paper. Has it been thoroughly addressed?


Writing Algorithm
====================

*   Read the title, the abstract, the introduction, and the conclusion of the paper

    Can you identify ALL 5 of the **Big 5**?

*    If *No*: you may reject the paper

*   If *Yes*: Is the research question important? Is it new/innovative and does it add value to the
    literature?

    *   If *No*: you may reject the paper

        +   When you reject a paper on the above grounds, you need to explain this to the journal editor.
            You always need to provide careful and thoughtful reasoning.
    
        +   This may sound harsh, but before submitting, authors should work hard on the “sell” of their paper,
            i.e., on convincing the reader that the paper is worth their time. 

    * If *Yes*: you still may end up rejecting but there's a good chance that you also may not
      reject

        + Read the paper thoroughly, then write up your review. Do so in as much space as you need, and do not
          skip anything, even the tedium.

        + A good review should start by summarizing the paper in one or two short paragraphs *in your own
          words*. Do not paraphrase the abstract! 

        + Offer two numbered lists:
        
          - Major comments: non-negotiable, constructive comments that you consider to be potential deal
            breakers; that you absolutely require to be addressed for the paper to be published

          - Minor comments: detailed and specific comments that are the small things you would like the authors
            to do in order to improve upon the paper

        + These two lists are a clear indication of what is negotiable or not, and numbered comments increase
          efficiency -- the authors can refer to specific comments more easily when responding to your review.

        + Make sure you give the authors suggestions on how to address your non-negotiable comments. 

        + If you think the authors cannot reasonably address your non-negotiable comments, you should
          recommend rejection so as to not waste anyone’s time.

        + What is a constructive comment: a comment that can actually be dealt with given a reasonable amount
          of sweat, fear, effort and work. 

        + Do not make impossible suggestions, for example: "Instead of using OLS, the author should pursue a
          structural discrete dynamic programming model to estimate the coefficients."

        + When in doubt as to whether a comment will be seen as demeaning, err on the side of being nicer.

        + As a referee, you are not a co-author. Do not push the authors to write the paper you would have
          written.
