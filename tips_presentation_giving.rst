Tips for Giving a Presentation in Economics
*********************************************



The Big 5
===========


Start with a title slide, mentioning your topic title and your name

For week 7 presentations, focus exclusively on the **Big 5**:

1)  What are you doing?

    In 25 words or less, and in plain English, what is the hypothesis or research question that you are
    investigating?

#)  Why is it important?

    There are usually many reasons for why your topic is important. Just point to most important ones.

#)  How is the existing literature different?

    Tell us about the gaps in the literature and how you are trying to fill them

    Be gentle towards other papers

#)  What are you doing that's better?

    What model are you using to answer the research question?

    What is your innovation/gap?

    New technique? Old technique in a new context? Little tweak?

#)  What did you find?

    Only provide main findings, first order effects

    For the purpose of the week 7 presentation, tell us what you expect to find; the type of result that
    you are looking for (I don't mean that you should guess your results)

    Do not be too modest

    Do not be too aggressive

Plan to have about 8 slides

Even research that is in the early stages can have a well-defined *takeaway*: What is the main thing
you want your audience to remember about your talk when they leave? Whatever that thing is, tell it
to them right now.

Minimize jargon

Give specific examples

Avoid too much detail

Don't digress
