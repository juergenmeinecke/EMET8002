Course Outline
**********************

Read this entire course outline carefully! 

Any items, rules, requirements in this course outline may be subject to changes. When this happens I
will announce it during the lecture. Announcements in the lecture supersede any information
contained in this course outline.


Course Description 
============================
The philosophy of Case Studies is that the best way to learn how to research is to do research.
Students conduct, under the supervision of faculty, their own research projects, culminating in the
writing of a research paper. Lectures will be given on a selection of topics that can prove useful
in research.  

Learning Outcomes
----------------------------
Ideally, at the end of the course you will have achieved the following:

* formulation of research objective
* execution of a research agenda to address the research objective
* a demonstration of your competency in the research methods your objective mandates
* writing a research paper
* presentation of the research project

Course Requirements and Assessments
======================================

There are five assessable items during the semester. All of these items are **compulsory**.

1.  Research paper (60% of overall mark) ::

        The objective is to write up a paper on the student's research project. The paper should be
        approximately 20 pages long (1.5 line spacing), it should be written in English and it
        should look like it is ready for submission to an academic journal.
        
        The paper will be evaluated on several criteria including 
        
        * the suitability of the model and methods chosen to answer the research question;

        * how well the particular economic techniques are executed;

        * demonstration of an understanding of the underlying assumptions;

        * understanding and interpretation of results;

        * overall clarity of presentation.
          
        The research paper is due on November 6, 12:00pm (sharp!). A 5 percentage point penalty will
        apply for every 24 hour period (or fraction thereof) delay.

2.  First student presentation (10% of overall mark) ::

        In the first presentation students should be able to define their research question, discuss
        related literature, describe the economic methods chosen to answer the question, discuss
        advantages and limitations of their approach, and place their work in context. 
        
        The objective of the presentations is to communicate work verbally, and is also a means of
        gaining feedback and ideas from class mates, the lecturer and their supervisor. The
        presentations will be evaluated on several criteria including content, design and delivery. 

3.  Second student presentation (10% of overall mark) ::

        In the second presentation students should be able to define their final work, present the
        research question, discuss related literature, methodology, results as well as a critical
        appraisal of their work.
        
        The objective of the presentations is to communicate work verbally, and is also a means of
        gaining feedback and ideas from class mates, the lecturer and their supervisor. The
        presentations will be evaluated on several criteria including content, design and delivery. 

4.  Seminar referee report (10% of overall mark) ::

        You need to write one academic referee report. You can choose any paper that is presented at
        the RSE during any of the four weekly seminars (check the RSE website) during the semester.
        Some guidelines for writing referee reports will be provided during class meetings. 
       
        The referee report will help you learn how to constructively and professionally critique
        academic work. You will assume the role of a consumer of research and, in doing so, gain an
        appreciation for the importance and difficulty of communicating your research in writing.
        Reading other peoples' research should help improve your own writing skills, putting you in
        a stronger position to produce a good research paper. (In economics, it is not enough to do
        good research. You also have to communicate it well.)
        
        The referee report will be evaluated on several criteria including the ability to
        constructively critique written and oral work of a peer. You should discuss the positive as
        well as the negative aspects of a paper; point out potential improvements; provide an
        overall assessment of the quality of the paper and its relative importance. 
        
        The referee report is due October 9, 12:00pm (sharp!). Late reports will not be accepted.

5.  Participation and Communication (10% of overall mark) ::

        Participation during class meetings is an essential way for you to contribute to the success
        of the course. For example, your feedback to your class mates' presentation will help them
        understand how you view their work.

        Furthermore, it is important that you communicate well with me throughout the semester. You
        need to let me know about progress (or lack thereof) with your project, report back to me
        about your rapport with your supervisor and be reachable via e-mail when I contact you. (I
        will contact you several times throughout the semester to learn about your progress.)




Scaling of Grades
--------------------

Final scores for the course will be determined by scaling the raw score totals to fit a sensible
distribution of grades. Scaling can increase or decrease a mark but does not change the order of
marks relative to the other students in the course. If it is decided that scaling is appropriate,
then the final mark awarded in a course may differ from the aggregation of the raw marks of each
assessment component.


Rules and Policies
============================

It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the rules and regulations and the policies
and procedures that are relevant to your studies at the ANU. 

ANU has educational policies, procedures and guidelines, which are designed to ensure that staff and
students are aware of the University's academic standards, and implement them. You can find the
University's education policies and an explanatory glossary at: `ANU Policies
<http://policies.anu.edu.au/ Students>`_.

Students are expected to have read the `Student Academic Integrity Policy <http://policies.anu.edu.au/ppl/document/ANUP_000392>`_
before the commencement of their course.  

Other key policies include: 

* Student Assessment (Coursework) 
  
* Student Surveys and Evaluations

The University also offers a number of support services for students. Information on these is available
online from `ANU Studentlife <http://students.anu.edu.au/studentlife/>`_.
